# handcricket
Its similar to game of hand cricket(1..2..3.. Chuck) which we use to play at school. Here we play it with a computer its a one-on-one game. 
In this the toss is done first. It asks u to choose any number between 0-10 and then computer throws its run.The 
addition of both results in an odd/even number. If u had choose even and the output of the toss is even.You get to select
either you want to bat or to bowl.
Suppose you win the toss and you choose to bat first.
You will be asked to press runs between(0-10)(both the numbers inclusive)
Suppose you enter 5 and computer enter 3 so your score is 5
in next turn you enter 7 and computer enters 2 so your score is now 5+7 its the run you score.
Now suppose if you and computer enter the same score then you are out.
And the computer gets to bat and then it enters its runs. If computer chases down your score you lose. And if you get it out before it can chase down you win.!!


It is made in Python.
